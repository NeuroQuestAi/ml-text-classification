This project is a simple text classification using multi-language BERT.
### Project ‚òÅÔ∏è

Details of the **BERT** model used:

- [BERT multilingual base model (cased)](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased)

This project was inspired by this source: 

- [Documents Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ouardasakram/documents-classification-using-bert-on-bbc-dataset/notebook)

### Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

It is necessary:

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

`Note:` A machine with a GPU is not required, but it is recommended to accelerate training.

### Datasets üíª

It was used the [BBC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sainijagjit/bbc-dataset) dataset to classify texts into the following labels:

- Business
- Entertainment
- Sport
- Tech
- Politics

The texts were translated into Portuguese using the Google Translator API, and then the English and Portuguese texts were combined to create a multilingual version.

### Build and Running üöÄ

Clone the project to your computer using Git:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:NeuroQuestAi/ml-text-classification.git
```

Go to the project root folder:

```shell
$ cd ml-text-classification.git
```

Use poetry to access the project:

```shell
$ poetry shell
```

Install all dependencies:

```shell
$ poetry install && poetry update 
```

Run the model training:

```shell
$ ./train 
```

This will generate the torch model in the models folder. Then just test the predictions with the command:

```shell
$ ./predictor 
```

`Note:` ML model settings are in the (config.json) file.
